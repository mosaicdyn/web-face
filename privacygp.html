        <p class="page-description">
          This privacy policy outlines how Rush B (hereinafter referred to as
          the "Application") by Denys Boiko (hereinafter referred to as the
          "Service Provider") operates as an ad-supported service with optional
          in-app purchases. By using the Application, you agree to the terms
          described below.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-description-header">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p class="page-description">
          The Application itself does not collect personally identifiable
          information and operates without requiring user registration.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description">
          However, third-party services integrated into the Application may
          collect and process limited technical or device-related data for
          purposes such as advertising, analytics, performance monitoring, and
          monetization.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-description-header">Advertising Services</h2>
        <p class="page-description">
          The Application displays ads using third-party advertising services
          such as Google AdMob. These services may collect data including:
        </p>
        <ul class="page-description">
          <li>Advertising ID</li>
          <li>Device information (e.g., model, OS version)</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>User interaction data</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="page-description">
          This data is used to serve personalized and non-personalized ads.
          Users can opt out of ad personalization through their Google account
          settings. The Application itself does not collect or store personal
          data.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-description-header">
          Analytics, A/B Testing, and Third-Party SDKs
        </h2>
        <p class="page-description">

          A/B Testing and UI Personalization:
        </h2>
        <p class="page-description">
          The Application may use analytics and feature configuration tools
          (such as Firebase Remote Config or Adapty) to test variations of the
          app experience in order to optimize usability and performance. These
          tools process data in an anonymized manner and do not identify users
          personally.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description">
          Please note: This list may not be exhaustive. Future updates of the
          Application may include additional third-party SDKs strictly for the
          same purposes-analytics, performance monitoring, or monetization. Any
          such changes will remain aligned with this Privacy Policy. We do not
          attempt to hide or obscure sensitive data collection, and any newly
          added tools will serve the same declared functions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-description-header">Push Notifications</h2>
